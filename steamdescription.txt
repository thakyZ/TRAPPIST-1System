The system is home to many different planets, some more hospitable than others.
My personal playstyle for this system and other systems that I have created is to build at least one base on each world, and at least one base in space.
How ever you can play this system however you want. You don't need to play any specific way.

As a joke and a nod to myself and other crossdressers, this is a system humans have moved to and chose the culture of being femboys.

This system contains the following planets:
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1669459989]Bylen, Dwate, Paradise[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1903620980]Rai, Jericu[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1813330640]Demus[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1965520709]Medieval Planet Complete[/url], Mars, Euorpa, Alien, Titan, EarthLike, Moon, and Triton

This pack does contain Weapon Core by default, but if you don't want to have Weapon Core you may remove it along with any other mod in this mod ack, it shouldn't break anything too horribly.

If you want to spawn in a new planet, and want economy station on it, you may have to make a local copy of this world first without loading in and disabling economy. Then pasting in the planet and then you can enable economy again.
